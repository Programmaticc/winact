# WindowsActivationFix
Cleaners and spoofers not only remove activation, but often make it impossible to activate again.         

The .bat file is the main tool.
Use the .exe version if the .bat doesn't work'
  
Activation.cpp is the source to Activation.exe

For 0xc0000022, 0xc004f016, 0xc004f012, 0xc004f015 and numerous other activation-related errors
