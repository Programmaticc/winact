# WindowsActivationFix
Cleaners and spoofers not only remove activation, but often make it impossible to activate again.         

The Activation.bat file is the main tool.
   
Use Activation.bat.exe version if the Activation.bat doesn't work
  
Activation.cpp is the source to Activation.exe

For 0xc0000022, 0xc004f016, 0xc004f012, 0xc004f015 and numerous other activation-related errors
